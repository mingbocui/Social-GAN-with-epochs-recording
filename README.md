This is the original Social-GAN, but I changed a little bit for better plot



## Setup
All code was developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 3.5 and PyTorch 0.4.

You can setup a virtual environment to run the code like this:

```bash
python3 -m venv env               # Create a virtual environment
source env/bin/activate           # Activate virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt   # Install dependencies
echo $PWD > env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/sgan.pth  # Add current directory to python path
# Work for a while ...
deactivate  # Exit virtual environment
```
